# LLM for Conversational Group Recommender System

In this project, we aim at exploring the possibility of supporting the group decision-making process using a
virtual assistant, which interacts with the group using a chat-based interface. Group members will be able
to discuss and propose items, in order to find a shared solution; the virtual assistant will process these
information, infer group members’ preferences, and provide suggestions to the group using baseline
aggregation strategies, prompting a ChatGPT with all these information to obtain recommendations and
textual explanations to discuss with the group.
